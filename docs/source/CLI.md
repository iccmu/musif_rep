# `musif` CLI tool

`musif` can also be used as a CLI tool.
If you have musif installed in your environment, you can access it using
`python -m musif`.

Alternatively, you can install musif system-wide with `pipx install musif`
(see pipx documentation for instructions: https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

Below, you can find the help page of the tool. To show it, just use `python -m musif -- -h` (or
`musif -- -h` if you installed it via `pipx`).

NAME
    musif - Python tool for extracting features from music score files.

SYNOPSIS
    musif <flags> [PATHS]...

DESCRIPTION
    This tool uses `music21` to load files, so any file format supported by `music21`
    also works, e.g. MIDI, MusicXML, Kern, ABC files. It uses cache, parallel
    processing, and ignore errors by default. See the options to disable them.

    This tool uses a default configuration that should work well in most cases. See
    [paper] for more benchmarks. By default, it extracts all features except the ones
    that require harmonic annotations. You can use `-y/--yaml` and `-c/--config` for
    more tweaks.

    Examples of usage:
        musif dataset/**/*.mid
            -> process all the midi files in `dataset`, searching files recursively in
            all the sub-directories
        musif *.xml --cache_dir=None
            -> process all xml files in this directory without using cache
        musif --source_dir=dataset --extension=.krn
            -> process all kern files in the directory `dataset`, searching files
            recursively in all the sub-drectories
        musif -- -h
            -> shows this help

    Installation:
        If you have musif installed in your environment, you can access this tool using
        `python -m musif`.

        Alternatively, you can install musif system-wide with `pipx install musif`
        (see pipx documentation for instructions: https://pypa.github.io/pipx/)

POSITIONAL ARGUMENTS
    PATHS
        one or more paths to file; if provided, the extraction is limited to them; these paths can be absolute or relative to the current directory; all the paths should contain a common parent part; incompatible with `--source_dir`

FLAGS
    -o, --output_path=OUTPUT_PATH
        Type: str
        Default: 'musif_features.csv'
        output file; extension is added or changed to 'csv'
    -s, --source_dir=SOURCE_DIR
        Type: Optional[str]
        Default: None
        relative path to the directory; searched recursively; incompatible with other files provided
    -e, --extension=EXTENSION
        Type: str
        Default: '.xml'
        extension, including the dot, e.g. '.mid', '.krn', '.mxl'; only has effect if `source_dir` is used, otherwise it's inferred from the file names; if one of ['.mxl', '.xml', '.musicxml'] is passed, all the other used as well; you can set it to a list or to a tuple to include multiple extensions;
    -n, --njobs=NJOBS
        Type: int
        Default: -1
        number of jobs used, according to joblib: -1 means "all the available virtual cores"; 1 means no parallel processing
    -c, --cache_dir=CACHE_DIR
        Type: str
        Default: 'musif_cache'
        directory where cache files are saved; set to 'None' to disable
    -i, --ignore_errors=IGNORE_ERRORS
        Type: bool
        Default: True
        True or False; if False, blocks when a file cannot be processed, if True, cprints a warning and continue
    -y, --yaml=YAML
        Type: Optional[str]
        Default: None
        path to a configuration file that will be used for both extraction and post-processing; command line options have the precedence on this yaml file
    -t, --tweaks=TWEAKS
        Type: dict
        Default: {}
        Further flags can be used to change musif's configuration (see the docs for possible options); for this, you should pass them as a dictionary, e.g. `musif -t '{musescore_dir
    -h, --harmony=HARMONY
        Type: Optional[Optional]
        Default: None
        extract harmonic features using musescore files from this directory
```
